## "Square, I Am Your Father (...kind of)" - Rectangle

According to the Liskov Substitution Principle, all children data types cannot violate any expectations of the parent type. 
In other words, you should be able to substitute any methods/objects/etc. from your parent type into the child type and the program should run normally.
In the example where Square is a child of Rectangle, and Rectangle has methods called setHeight() and setWidth(), this violates the Liskov Principle because when you run Square.setHeight(), it will also set the width.
Separately, this violates the Single Responsibility Principle, because Square.setHeight() and Square.setWidth() are no longer independent methods - the result of one will change the other.
